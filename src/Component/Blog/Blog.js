                        <h4 className='text-center'>Authentication</h4><br />
                        <p>1.Authentication verifies who the user is.</p> <br />
                        <p>2.Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user. </p><br />
                        <p>3.Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process. </p><br />
                        <p>4.Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user. </p><br />
                        <p>5. Example: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access to an HR application that includes their personal pay information, vacation time, and 401K data.</p>

                        <h4 className='text-center'>Authorization</h4> <br />
                        <p>1.Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</p><br />
                        <p>2.Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</p><br />
                        <p>3.Authorization always takes place after authentication.</p> <br />
                        <p>4.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</p><br />
                        <p>5.Example: Once their level of access is authorized, employees and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the permissions set by the organization.</p><br />
